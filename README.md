# Telecom-Churn---Group-Case-Study
customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.     For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal.     To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.
Analysed customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.
There are two main models of payment in the telecom industry - postpaid (customers pay a monthly/annual bill after using the services) and prepaid (customers pay/recharge with a certain amount in advance and then use the services).
In the postpaid model, when customers want to switch to another operator, they usually inform the existing operator to terminate the services, and you directly know that this is an instance of churn.
However, in the prepaid model, customers who want to switch to another network can simply stop using the services without any notice, and it is hard to know whether someone has actually churned or is simply not using the services temporarily
